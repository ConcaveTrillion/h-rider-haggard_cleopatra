    <h2>
      DEDICATION
    </h2>
    <h3>
      My dear Mother,
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have for a long while hoped to be allowed to dedicate some book of mine
      to you, and now I bring you this work, because whatever its shortcomings,
      and whatever judgment may be passed upon it by yourself and others, it is
      yet the one I should wish you to accept.
    </p>
    <p>
      I trust that you will receive from my romance of “Cleopatra” some such
      pleasure as lightened the labour of its building up; and that it may
      convey to your mind a picture, however imperfect, of the old and
      mysterious Egypt in whose lost glories you are so deeply interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your affectionate and dutiful Son,
    </p>
    <p>
      H. Rider Haggard.
    </p>
    <p>
      January 21, 1889.
    </p>
